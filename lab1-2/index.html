                    <p class="mainText">Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers 
                        in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most 
                        performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition 
                        from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. 
                        His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and 
                        late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is 
                        typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 
                        1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles 
                        of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized 
                        as heroic. During this time, he began to suffer increasingly from deafness. 
                        In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical 
                        form and expression.

                    <p class="mainText">Born in Bonn, Beethoven's musical talent was obvious at 
                        an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his 
                        father Johann van Beethoven. Beethoven was later taught by the composer and 
                        conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe, under whose tutelage he published his first 
                        work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional 
                        home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, 
                        and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and 
                        studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, 
                        and he was soon patronized by Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted 
                        in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.

                        His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, 
                        and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. Despite his 
                        hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering 
                        his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto 
                        appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the Emperor), 
                        dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, was premiered in 1811, 
                        without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave 
                        up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his 
                        unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his 
                        brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown "Immortal Beloved" (1812).

                        After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of 
                        his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature chamber music and 
                        the late piano sonatas. His only opera, Fidelio, first performed in 1805, was 
                        revised to its final version in 1814. He composed Missa solemnis between 1819 and 
                        1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, one of the first examples of a choral symphony, 
                        between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his late string quartets, including 
                        the Grosse Fuge, of 1825â€“1826 are among his final achievements. After some months of 
                        bedridden illness, he died in 1827. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.

                        <b>Museums</b><br>
                        There is a museum, the Beethoven House, the place of his birth, in central Bonn. The same city has hosted a musical festival, the Beethovenfest, since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.
                        The Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies, in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, in the campus of San Jose State University, California. serves as a museum, research center, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to Beethoven's life and works.[212]

                        <b>Monuments</b><br>
                        The Beethoven Monument in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original Beethovenhalle in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of Franz Liszt). Vienna honoured Beethoven with a statue in 1880.[213]

                        The third largest crater on Mercury is named in his honour,[214] as is the main-belt asteroid 1815 Beethoven.
                        Beethoven's music features twice on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes.
